### THIS TOOL IS EXPERIMENTAL â€” USE WITH CAUTION

ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§

A set of tools and common code for working with typescript with the ability to
switch between different toolchains.

## Motivation

There are currently a number of ways to emit typescript, including but not
limited to tsc, swc, and oxc. This is an experiment to make it easy to try these
tools out, switch between them for perf testing, and plug them into different
workflows (like metro bundling)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @rnx-kit/tools-typescript --dev
```

or if you're using npm

```sh
npm add --save-dev @rnx-kit/tools-typescript
```
